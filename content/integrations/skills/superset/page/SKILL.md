# Superset Pages

A page is an **`.html` document** published to a URL people in the org can
open. Publish a single file and it must be self-contained; publish a directory
and its `index.html` is the document, with the images, stylesheets, and media
it references by relative path published alongside it. Every publish mints a version, so a page has history. Readers can
pin a comment to any element on it, and those comments come back to an agent to
fix. That is what makes a page a working surface rather than an export.

Pages are served from their own origin under a strict content policy. Most of
the work in this skill is respecting that policy; a page that ignores it looks
fine locally and breaks silently once published.

## When a page is the right surface

Publish a page when the work has a **reader** and wants a **link**: a report
someone will skim, a dashboard for a standup, a comparison table, a diagram, a
walkthrough of what you changed.

Other skills produce exactly that and stop at the terminal. A standup digest, a
summary of a parallel run across several workspaces, a feature scorecard, the
screenshots from a browser or desktop verification: each has a reader who is not
in the session, and each is better as a link than as scrollback. Recurring ones
gain the most, since republishing versions one page rather than littering the
org with a new one every day. That only holds when the workspace and the path
both stay the same, which is the identity of a page: a job that runs somewhere
new each time needs `--page <id>` instead.

Don't publish when the artifact belongs in the repo (source, docs, config: put
those in files and commit them), or when it genuinely needs a server, a
database, or a login. A page has none of those.

If you're unsure, ask. Publishing is cheap and reversible, but a page the user
didn't want is noise in their org's list.

### Offer one before you are asked

Most people never go looking for this feature, so the offer is the onboarding.
When you finish something that has a reader and wants a link, say so and offer
to publish it. Don't wait to be asked, and don't publish silently either: a
page the user didn't want still lands in their org's list.

Offer when the thing you just produced is one of these:

- a walkthrough of a change, a PR, or a migration you just made
- a comparison: options side by side, before and after, two designs, two
  benchmark runs
- a report or digest someone outside the session will read: a standup, a
  status roundup, a feature scorecard
- an investigation or incident writeup with a timeline
- verification evidence: screenshots from a browser, desktop, or simulator run
- anything you were about to paste as a long wall of terminal output that a
  teammate is supposed to read

One line is the whole offer, and it names what the page would be:

> This reads better as a page your team can open and comment on. Want me to
> publish it?

Then stop and let them answer. Publish on a yes, drop it on a no, and don't
raise it again for the same piece of work.

Stay quiet the rest of the time. An ordinary answer, a quick fix, a question
you just answered in two sentences, a file you edited: none of those want a
link, and an offer attached to every reply is noise that trains people to
ignore the one that matters. If you already offered in this session and were
turned down, take that as the user's standing preference unless they say
otherwise. When the user asked for a page outright, skip the offer and build it.

### A page, not a Claude artifact

Claude Code carries an `Artifact` tool that also publishes a self-contained
HTML document to a private URL, and it is the wrong instrument here. An
artifact belongs to the one person who made it: it is absent from the
organization's page list, carries no workspace or entry path to version
against, and its comments reach whoever happens to still have the session
open. A page is the org's surface: listed, versioned on every publish, and
wired so a pinned comment comes back to an agent that can act on it.

So when the user asks for a page, or for anything a teammate will open, this
skill is the one that runs. Reach for `Artifact` only when the user names it,
or when there is no Superset workspace to publish into. Inside a Superset
terminal a first `Artifact` publish is denied by a hook that points back here;
that denial is the reminder, not an error to work around. Someone who wants it
gone entirely sets `SUPERSET_PAGES_NUDGE=off` in their terminal environment.

## The content policy, which is what actually bites

Every page gets its own origin, `https://<pageId>.frame.supersetusercontent.com`, and
is framed with `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms
allow-popups"`. So the page is a real origin of its own, and a locked-down
one. The policy is `default-src 'none'` with a short allowlist, and it is
enforced identically in the desktop pane and the web viewer:

- **No network from script.** `fetch`, `XHR`, `EventSource` and WebSockets are
  all blocked, and so is `fetch("data:...")`: a page cannot read its own
  inlined data URIs back out. Write pages that need no network at all: bake
  the data into the document as a literal, or decode base64 in JavaScript
  (`atob`, then `Uint8Array.from`).
- **No compiling code at runtime.** `script-src` carries no `'unsafe-eval'`,
  so `eval()` and `new Function()` both raise an `EvalError`. This rules out
  inlining any library that builds functions at runtime, which includes
  several chart and templating libraries and a number of date and expression
  helpers. Check for it before you reach for a dependency: the page renders
  nothing and gives no visible reason why.
- **No scripts or stylesheets from a remote host, with one exception.**
  `<script src="https://…">` is always blocked. `<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://…">` is blocked too, except from `fonts.googleapis.com`, so
  a Google Fonts `<link>` tag works as-is. A directory publish's own files
  load fine (relative `src`/`href`), and any remote font *file* is allowed,
  so an inline `@font-face { src: url(https://…) }` also works for fonts
  from elsewhere.
- **Images, video and audio may be remote** (`https:`, `data:` or `blob:`),
  but prefer `data:` URIs for anything the page cannot do without: a reader
  with the network off sees nothing, and a remote image makes every reader's
  browser call that host directly, which hands a third party the IP address
  of everyone who opens the page.
- **Browser storage works** and is scoped to the page: `localStorage`,
  `sessionStorage`, `indexedDB` and cookies persist across reloads and across
  versions of the same page, but only in that one browser. Use it for a chosen
  tab or filter. For anything the page should remember for everyone, use
  `window.superset.storage` below.
- **No parent access.** The viewer is a different origin, so
  `window.parent.document` and `window.top.location` throw. Superset injects
  its own scripts for comment anchoring and for the storage API; don't build a
  `postMessage` handshake of your own on top of them.
- **No form submission.** `form-action 'none'`: a `<form>` may exist for its
  controls, but submitting it goes nowhere. Handle inputs in script.

Scripts and popups *do* work. Inline JS runs normally, so charts, filters,
sorting, tabs, and interactive controls are all fine, as long as everything
they need is already in the file.

## Shared storage: `window.superset.storage`

A page can remember things for everyone who opens it. Each key holds **one
slot per person**: you write yours, you read everyone's. That makes a poll, an
RSVP sheet, a claim list or a checklist a few lines, and it makes two people
writing at once a non-issue, because nobody ever writes someone else's slot.

```js
const store = window.superset?.storage;
if (await store?.ready) {
  await store.set("lunch-vote", "Ramen");      // my slot under this key
  const mine = await store.get("lunch-vote");  // read it back
  const all = await store.getAll("lunch-vote");
  // [{ userId, name, value, updatedAt }, ...] everyone's slots
  store.subscribe("lunch-vote", (records) => render(records));
  await store.remove("lunch-vote");
}
```

Rules that matter when you write one:

- **Always handle absence.** `store` is undefined and `store.ready` resolves
  false wherever there is no host: the thumbnail renderer, a `file://`
  preview, a signed-out reader. Render a sensible read-only view from zero
  records rather than a broken page.
- **Derive, don't accumulate.** A tally is computed from `getAll` on every
  render. Never keep a running count in a record.
- **Values are JSON and bounded**: at most 64 KiB each, 500 keys per person,
  and 4 MiB for the whole page. An over-size write rejects.
- **Branch on `error.code`**, never on the message: `quota_exceeded`,
  `rate_limited`, `unauthenticated`, `invalid`, `unavailable`, and `revoked`.
  `revoked` is terminal: the page's access changed while it was open, so
  surface it once and stop retrying.
- **Who is reading** is on the object: `store.viewer` is `{ userId, name,
  image }`, `store.author` is true for the page's author, and
  `store.writable` says whether this viewer may write. Use `store.author` for
  controls only the author should have, like closing a poll.
- **Signed-in viewers of the page's organization only.** A signed-out reader
  of an `everyone` page gets no storage, so the page must still render.
- Writes are per-person, so there is nothing to merge and no need for a CRDT.

## The other hard limits

1. **`.html` only.** Any other extension is rejected at the CLI.
2. **One file, or one directory.** `superset pages publish ./report/`
   publishes a directory: `index.html` is the page, and every other file
   ships at its relative path, so `<video src="demo.mp4">`,
   `<link href="site.css">` and `<script src="app.js">` all work. Asset
   paths may not start with `versions/`, `files/`, `_superset/` or `~`, or
   be named `thumbnail.jpg`. Assets go up to 1 GiB each; on republish,
   unchanged assets are not re-uploaded. Prefer H.264 MP4 or WebM for
   video: iPhone `.mov` recordings may not play in every browser. Remote
   CDN links and external stylesheets are still blocked; for a single-file
   page, inline all CSS and JS and embed images as `data:` URIs.
3. **16 MB maximum for the HTML document itself**, and base64 `data:` URIs
   count toward it at ~1.37× their
   raw size. A few small SVGs or PNGs are fine; a photo gallery is not.
4. **Full-bleed frame.** There is no chrome around the document: what you
   write is the whole surface, edge to edge. The injected theme paints the
   background (see below), so inherit it or set your own, never leaving it to
   the browser default.

Check before publishing: no `<script src>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` pointing
at a remote host, no `fetch` of any kind including of a `data:` URI, no `eval`
or `new Function` anywhere in the file or in anything you inlined, page fits in
16 MB, opens correctly from `file://` with the network disabled. Remote images
are the one permitted exception: they go blank offline, which is the price of
not inlining them.

## Structure and theme

Every page is served with a stylesheet of ours inlined at the top of `<head>`.
You never write it. The origin injects it into the document on the way out, so
it reaches pages published before it existed too. It gives bare HTML a readable
default: type scale, links, lists, tables, code blocks, `box-sizing`,
responsive images. **Don't inline a CSS reset, a normalize, or a webfont.**
Write semantic HTML and most pages need no `<style>` block at all.

What it deliberately does *not* set, because it reaches pages written before it
existed and those pages never agreed to it: padding on `body`, a width cap on
your text, or a height on your `<iframe>`s. The frame stays full-bleed and the
measure is yours to choose (see `--sp-measure` below).

Start from this skeleton:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Q3 pipeline</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>Q3 pipeline</h1>
      <p>Where every open deal stands going into Q4.</p>
      <section>…</section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

Every rule in the theme is wrapped in `:where()`, which carries no
specificity. Any selector you write beats it: `body { background: #0b0b0b }`
in your own `<style>` wins outright, and a class of your own is never touched
by it. So the theme is a floor, not a cage: lean on it for the ordinary parts
and style the parts that make this page itself.

### Light and dark

The theme is light unless you ask for dark, with a class on `<body>` that flips
background, text, borders, code blocks and native controls together:

```html
<body class="dark">
  <!-- or class="light", which is the default -->
</body>
```

It does **not** follow the reader's system setting on its own, and that is
deliberate. A page that set a background but no text colour, or set one on
`<html>` rather than `<body>`, would take the other half of the pair from a
palette that inverted underneath it, and end up dark text on a dark ground.
Opting in keeps that decision with the page that can actually see its own
colours.

So: add `class="dark"` when the page's visuals assume it: a chart with
baked-in colours, a screenshot with a dark background, a diagram with hardcoded
strokes. To follow the reader's system setting, ask for that too:

```html
<body class="auto">
```

`auto` is the right choice for text and tables, where nothing is pinned to one
scheme. Use it whenever the page has no baked-in colours of its own, but reach
for it deliberately, and if you hardcode any colour anywhere on the page, set
its partner as well so the pair can never come from two different themes.

### Tokens

These are Superset's own palette, so a page read next to the app belongs to
it. Build on them rather than hardcoding colours and both themes keep working:

| Token | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `--sp-bg` | Page background |
| `--sp-surface` | Raised or inset panels |
| `--sp-text` | Body text |
| `--sp-muted` | Secondary text, captions, table headers |
| `--sp-border` | Rules and hairlines |
| `--sp-accent` / `--sp-accent-text` | Links and emphasis, and text on top of the accent |
| `--sp-code-bg` | Code background: a translucent tint of the surrounding text colour, so it sits on whatever background the page paints |
| `--sp-chart-1` … `--sp-chart-5` | Categorical series colours, distinct in both themes |
| `--sp-radius` | Corner radius |
| `--sp-measure` | Reading measure for prose blocks |
| `--sp-font-sans` / `--sp-font-mono` | Font stacks |

The accent is a near-neutral, the way the app's is. It carries emphasis
through weight and underline rather than hue. Reach for `--sp-chart-*` when you
need colours that separate from one another, and don't paint a chart in five
shades of the accent.

Redefine any of them on `:root` to re-skin the whole page in one place:

```css
:root {
  --sp-accent: #b4531f;
  --sp-measure: 62ch;
}
```

Define overrides on `:root`, not on `body`. The theme's own values live on
`:root`, and a value set closer to the content would win in only one of the two
colour schemes.

## Design

The page should look deliberate. Avoid the house style of generic AI output:
purple-to-blue gradients, everything centered, uniform pill-rounded corners on
every element, Inter (or system-sans) for every line, and emoji as section
icons. Those read as "generated" at a glance.

Instead: hold to one palette (the tokens above, or a real one of your own)
set a typographic scale with actual contrast between heading and body, and let
the layout follow the content: a data-dense table wants a wide flush-left page,
a narrative report wants the default measure. Use whitespace for grouping
instead of borders on everything.

Make it responsive with relative units and flex/grid, and give wide content
(tables, code blocks, charts) its own `overflow-x: auto` container so the page
body never scrolls sideways.

If the user's project has a design system, read it first and match it.

## Publish

```bash
superset pages publish report.html \
  --title "Q3 pipeline" \
  --description "Where every open deal stands going into Q4" \
  --label "first draft"

# Or a directory: index.html is the page, everything else rides along
superset pages publish ./report/ --title "Q3 pipeline"
```

`--title` defaults to the filename with dashes and underscores turned into
spaces, so name the file well or pass the flag. `--label` is what shows in
version history; write what changed, not "update".

**Attach a workspace whenever you have one.** The CLI records the file's path
relative to the workspace root as the page's entry path, and that path is the
key: publish the same path again and it becomes **version 2 of the same page**
rather than a second page. That is the only way a republish versions itself
without you tracking an id.

Write the `.html` **inside the workspace**, not in `/tmp` or an agent
scratchpad. A file outside the workspace has no relative path, so it falls back
to being keyed by filename alone (`/external/report.html`), which means two
unrelated files with the same name will version each other. Keeping it in the
workspace also keeps the source next to the work it describes.

Outside a workspace entirely (a chat session, or a shell with no
`$SUPERSET_WORKSPACE_ID` and no `--workspace`) the publish still goes through.
The page is created and listed like any other; it just has no entry path, so
there is nothing for a later publish to resolve against. The result says
`"unanchored": true` and carries a `republish` command with the id already in
it. **Keep that command** and run it to add a version. Publishing the same
file again without `--page` creates a second page, and the link you already
shared keeps showing the first.

Keep the source file. It is the only copy you can edit; the published version is
derived from it.

## Update an existing page

Two routes, and the difference matters:

```bash
superset pages publish report.html --label "fixed Q3 totals"   # same path in the same workspace
superset pages publish report.html --page <page-id> --label "…" # anywhere, explicit
```

Use `--page` whenever you're outside the original workspace, the file moved, or
you're not certain the path still matches. A wrong guess doesn't error; it
quietly creates a *new* page, and the reader's link keeps showing the old one.

## Visibility

`org` (the default) or `just_me`, set with `--visibility`. Anything wider is not
settable from the CLI. A new page is readable by the org, because that is what a
page is usually for; pass `--visibility just_me` when the user wants a draft only
they can open.

Visibility belongs to the page, not to the publish. Republishing never changes
it, so a page someone narrowed to `just_me` stays that way through every later
version, and a page created before `org` became the default is still `just_me`
until someone widens it.

## Read a page back

```bash
superset pages list --workspace <id>     # or omit --workspace for the whole org
superset pages list --search "Q3 close"  # -q also works; matches title or slug
superset pages get <page-id-or-slug>
superset pages versions <page-id-or-slug>
superset pages pull <page-id-or-slug> --version 2 > v2.html
```

`pull` writes HTML to stdout; use it to recover a source file you no longer
have, or to diff what actually shipped against what you have locally.

`list` returns every page it can see, so reach for `--search` before you reach
for a pipe into `grep`. Two flags change that: `--limit <1-200>` returns a
single batch, and `--cursor` continues from where a batch stopped.

They also change the JSON. Under `--json`, a plain `list` is a bare array, but
passing either flag wraps it as `{ items, nextCursor }`. Feed that `nextCursor`
back as `--cursor` until it comes back `null`. Parsing the output? Either don't
pass the flags, or handle the envelope. The other two modes are unaffected: the
default table looks the same and tells you when there's more, and `--quiet`
prints ids either way.

`get` carries `workspaceLinks`: the workspace and the path each publish
resolved against. When you have lost the source, pull it back to that path
inside that workspace and a later publish versions the page instead of minting
a second one. An empty list means the page has no path to resolve against, so
`--page <page-id>` is the only way to add a version.

## Answer comments

A reader clicks an element on the published page and pins a comment to it. When
they hand the thread to an agent, the prompt that arrives names the page, and
for each thread gives a `thread:` id, an `at:` CSS selector path from `<body>`,
and the element's text at the time of writing.

**That selector points into the published HTML, which is the same document as
your source file.** That document is the `index.html` you published, not any
asset beside it, so the anchor locates the exact element to edit. Quoted text alone doesn't; the same words often
appear more than once.

The loop, in order:

```bash
superset pages comments list --page <page-id-or-slug>
# edit the source file, fixing what each thread asked for
superset pages publish report.html --page <page-id> --label "addressed review comments"
superset pages comments reply --thread <thread-id> "Recomputed from the Q3 close; the total is 1.42M now."
superset pages comments resolve --thread <thread-id>
```

Rules that keep this honest:

- **Fix the source, then republish, then reply.** A reply pointing at a version
  that doesn't exist yet wastes the reader's time.
- **Reply before resolving.** Resolving silently closes the thread with no
  record of what changed. Say what you did, then close it.
- **Only answer threads that were handed to you.** Other threads on the page are
  someone else's conversation.
- **Don't resolve what you didn't fix.** If a comment asks for something you
  can't do or disagree with, reply saying so and leave it open for a human.

Reopen with `superset pages comments resolve --thread <id> --reopen`.

## When it fails

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Only .html files can be published as a page` | Wrong extension, or you pointed at a directory |
| Publish rejected on size | Over 16 MB; the `data:` URIs are almost always why |
| A new page appeared instead of a version | Published from outside the workspace, or the path changed; use `--page <id>` |
| Reader gets a 404 | Page is `just_me`, either set that way or created before `org` became the default; widen it with `--visibility org` |
| Page is blank once published, fine locally | A script threw, or the page loads a script or stylesheet from a remote host |
| A chart or widget renders nothing and logs no error | The library compiles code with `new Function` or `eval`, which the policy refuses; pick one that does not |
| Fonts missing when published | A stylesheet `<link>` from a host other than `fonts.googleapis.com`; inline the `@font-face` instead, or use `--sp-font-sans` |
| Page ignores `class="dark"` | The class belongs on `<body>`, not on `<html>` or a wrapper |
| A theme token has no effect | It was redefined on `body`; move the override to `:root` |
| Images missing when published | `http://` URLs, or the reader is offline; embed as `data:` URIs |
